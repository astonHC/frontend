Intuitive Frontend GUI for my Applications

# Motive:

This repository serves to provide functionality behind an intuitive frontend for applications 
I intend of making in C.

Case in point, I am developing in conjunction with the backend of my own portfolio project of my Mega Drive Emulator.

In addition, I am looking to develop this as a technical aid for being able to provide functionality for any other applications
I make in the future (possibily in my Dissertation)
